# FooBar
My solutions to the Google FooBar problems. [Some background info on Google FooBar.](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/google-foo-bar-challenge/)

There are five levels, each more involved than the last. I'm currently on Level 4. This repository is split up into directories for each level. Inside each directory is my solution to each problem, named chronologically and with a brief description of the problem. There's also a comments folder within each directory, which contains a more complete description of each problem along with any thoughts and documentation that didn't go into the code itself.
