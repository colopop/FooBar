# Level 1 Question 1: Eliminate all instances of n-plicates

We're given a list `l` and a number `n`. We need to eliminate all elements in `l` that occur more than `n` times. 

My solution is O(len(l)) complexity. There's an initial pass through the list to mark elements for removal, followed by a second pass to create and return the modified list. I used a Counter object here, which is a specialized python dict which returns `0` for keys it doesn't recognize rather than `KeyError`. This is useful for counting up items in a list. So in the first pass, we addd each element to the Counter and track how many times it appears. The second pass is in the form of a list comprehension, which creates a list composed only of elements that occurred few enough times according to the Counter (`dict` is implemented as a hash table, so lookup is O(1)).
